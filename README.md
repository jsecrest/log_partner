Read logs with ease!

I'm working on some personal projects and logging data with the built in python
`logging` module. I want to make reading these logs clearer with highlighting,
parsing, dictionary formatting for legibility. I also want to leave my logs in a
single line format.

Obviously I'm tailoring this for my own use and needs, but it's free for use if anyone thinks its helpful.
